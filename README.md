# Voice Bot
A multi-threaded voice bot application that integrates speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), wake word detection, and a language model for real-time conversational capabilities. This project leverages a producer-consumer approach with parallel processing using threads and queues for fast inference on CPU.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
Before running the bot, make sure your system has the following installed:

## 🔊 Audio Dependencies
ffmpeg: Required for audio processing (used by Whisper)

portaudio: For PyAudio microphone input

## ⚙️ Build Tools (for llama-cpp-python)
cmake and C/C++ Build Tools:

On Ubuntu: sudo apt install build-essential cmake

On Windows: Install "Build Tools for Visual Studio" with C++ components

### Python version: 3.12 (ideally 3.12.3)

## 🔑 Setting Up Wake Word Detection
Sign up at Picovoice Console and:

Get your Access Key

Create and download a custom wake word (.ppn) file

Place your .ppn file inside the wakeup/ folder.

Open wakeup/wake.py and update the file name in the Porcupine config:
keyword_paths=["your_wake_word.ppn"]

## Create a .env file in the root with your key:

PORCUPINE=your-access-key-here

## 📦 Installation
Clone the repo and navigate to it:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/SrabanMondal/voice-bot.git
cd voice-bot
```
Install Python dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

▶️ Running the Voice Bot
After setup, simply run:
```sh
python -m app.main
```
Make sure your microphone is enabled and you’re using Python 3.12 (exact version 3.12.3 is best for compatibility with llama-cpp-python).

## Technical Details
Multi-Threading: Each component (STT, TTS, wake word detection, and LLM) runs in its own thread for concurrent execution, improving responsiveness.</br>
Producer-Consumer Approach: The TTS module uses a producer-consumer pattern with parallel processing via threads to achieve fast text-to-speech conversion.</br>
Token Streaming: Queues are utilized to stream tokens from the language model to the TTS module, enabling efficient CPU-based inference.</br>
Testing Status: The project is functional but requires extensive testing to ensure stability and performance under various conditions.</br>
